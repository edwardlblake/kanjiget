Step 0, Required Tools
----------------------

* Web browser to get files
* Decompressors for zip
* Racket from http://www.racket-lang.org/



Step 1, Download KANJIDIC2
--------------------------

1. Visit: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/

2. Download kanjidic2.xml.gz from the site and ungzip it
   Note: Many browsers will ungzip the file during the
         download.

3. Move the kanjidic2.xml file to the folder where 
   kanjidb.rkt resides


Step 2, Download RADKFILEs
--------------------------

1. Visit: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kradinf.html

2. Download kradzip.zip from the site and unzip it

3. Move the radkfile and radkfile2 files to the folder where 
   kanjidb.rkt resides


Step 3, Rename or delete old data files
---------------------------------------

1. The data file generator in step 4 won't create new data files if 
   existing data files in a nearby folder (specifically the parent
   folder, adjacent "data" folder and "data" subfolder) are still 
   around, so rename the old files:

     kanjimtx.dat
     knjidxl0.dat
     knjirdc0.dat


Step 4, Generate files (steps for Windows)
------------------------------------------

1. Open a command line window and
   cd to the folder where kanjidb.rkt resides

2. If you have installed Racket in Program Files then:
   SET PATH="C:\Program Files\Racket\"


Step 4 continued, Generate files
--------------------------------

3. Type at the command line:
   > racket
   You'll see something like this:

   Welcome to Racket v5.3.
   > _

4. Issue three commands:

  > (require "wiktionarydb.rkt")
  > (make-data-files-from-kanjidic2
     "kanjidic2.xml")
  > (make-data-file-from-radkfiles
     '("radkfile" "radkfile2"))

5. To exit racket
   > (exit)
