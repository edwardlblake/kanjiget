=============================================

Step 0, Required Tools
----------------------

* Web browser to get files
* bz2 decompressor such as bz2, or WinRAR on Windows
* Racket at http://www.racket-lang.org/


Step 1, Download the Wiktionary database backup dump
----------------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to http://dumps.wikimedia.org/

2. click on "Database backup dumps", you should now be on a page
   with the title: "Database dump progress"

3. Search on this page for "enwiktionary" (for English Wiktionary)
   and click on the latest one. You should now be on a page with 
   the title: "enwiktionary dump progress on 201YMMDD"

4. Download the "pages-articles" bz2 file from here.
   The entry will look something like:

  2012-09-20 22:04:53  done  Articles, templates, media/file
                             descriptions, and primary meta-pages.

       2012-09-20 22:04:51: enwiktionary (ID 19494) 3302572 pages
       (683.9|3222983.7/sec all|curr), 3302572 revs (683.9|558.2/sec 
       all|curr), 96.6%|96.6% prefetched (all|curr), ETA 2012-09-21 
       04:08:40 [max 18231295]

     enwiktionary-20120920-pages-articles.xml.bz2 338.8 MB

5. Wait a bit for it finish downloading, this file isn't big like the
   main Wikipedia site, but its still big.

6. Extract the bz2 file to attain an xml file. If your bz2 file was
   enwiktionary-20120920-pages-articles.xml.bz2  then you should get
   enwiktionary-20120920-pages-articles.xml
   Note: The bz2 file mentioned here is 338 MB which gets expanded
         to 2 gigs (2,646 MB), just to mention for disk space
         requirements.

7. Place the xml file in the same directory as wiktionarydb.rkt


Step 2, rename the old dat files
------------------------------

1. The data file generator in step 3 won't create new data files if 
   existing data files in a nearby folder (specifically the parent
   folder, adjacent "data" folder and "data" subfolder) are still 
   around, so rename the old files:

     wiktdata.dat
     wiktindx.dat
     wiktlkup.dat


Step 3, Generate data files (steps for Windows)
-----------------------------------------------

1. Open the command line

2. cd to the folder where wiktionarydb.rkt resides

3. If you have installed Racket in Program Files then:
   SET PATH="C:\Program Files\Racket\"


Step 4 continued, Generate files
--------------------------------

4. Type at the command line:
   > racket
   You'll see something like this:

   Welcome to Racket v5.3.
   > _

5. Issue two commands:

  > (require "wiktionarydb.rkt")
  > (create-wiktionary-data-file-if-needed
     "enwiktionary-20120812-pages-articles.xml"
     "knjidxl0.dat" "wiktdata.dat" "wiktindx.dat" "wiktlkup.dat")

6. A stream of "incl: ..." should appear, don't worry about the
   funny characters (mojibake), most likely the code page of 
   your command line box can't display the kanji characters.

7. Wait a few minutes to complete, after this step everything is
   done.

8. To exit racket
   > (exit)
